Instructions

I have included the BouncyCastle library, as AFS was being slow to use the provided one. This one is version 1.48, versus 1.47 that was provided, so it should not make much a difference.

Also, the commands are different on Windows and OSX/*nix. This is due to using a colon on *nix based OSes and a semicolon on Windows. Also, note that you compile WHILE YOU ARE IN THE src directory!!!! This is because I (properly) made the application part of a package!


To compile:

WHILE YOU ARE IN THE src DIRECTORY!

On Windows:
javac -cp .;bcprov-jdk15on-148.jar mgj7/cryptohw1/*.java

On OSX or *nix:
javac -cp .:bcprov-jdk15on-148.jar mgj7/cryptohw1/*.java


To run:

WHILE YOU ARE IN THE src DIRECTORY!

On Windows:
java -cp .;bcprov-jdk15on-148.jar mgj7/cryptohw1/MainApp

On OSX or *nix:
java -cp .:bcprov-jdk15on-148.jar mgj7/cryptohw1/MainApp
